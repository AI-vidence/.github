Welcome to the repo of **AI-vidence** ! a french start up dedicated *to the explanability of AIs*.

Since 2021, we've been working on developping tools to audit AIs, and extract knowledge from what they 'learn'.

Our first product is called **AntakIA**. 

This stands for *'A New Tool to Acquire Knowledge from artIficiAl intelligence'*.

AntakIA has been awarded by the French bank an insurance regulator (**ACPR**) on its explanability approach ! (between local and global : along with other team members (kudo, JM Schertzer !), we called it 'regional'). 

We also belong to the French national initiative to make AI more robust, which is called **Confiance.AI**.
We've successfully tested this approach in credit granting, and reducing false positives on vast system of Time Series.

Happy to benefit from your comments and commits on AntakIA Open Source edition ! soon to be released !!

Let's keep in touch !
